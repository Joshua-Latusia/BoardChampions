# BoardChampions
Interactive board game using OpenCV and C++

I made this project along with 5 other students for the last project of the second year of my Computer Science. 
This project was programmed in C++ and made use of the OpenCV library. 
This application made it possible to play our own designed game Board Champions by placing different card on our projected playing field.
By using OpenCv we could read out the different type of cards using vision and display the actions on the tv screen as seen in this video. 
For this project, I designed the playing cards and did most of the coding for the Vision of the game.
